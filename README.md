# Techdegree Project 1

 Unit 1:

 Number Guessing Game:

This was a TreeHouse Tech Degree Project that is terminal/console based.

The program has selected a random number for the user to try and guess.
The user will be prompted with a welcome banner and asked to guess a number
between the given range. They will also see what the current high score is. The
high score is lowest amount of guesses. If the user guesses outside of the number
range they will be told to try again inside the number range while still counting
as a guess. If the user inputs an invalid guess like "two" instead of 2 the user
will be prompted that was not an integer, try again, while still counting as a
guess. The user will get Higher or Lower hits along the way until they guess the
correct number. Once they guess the random number they will be shown the amount
of guesses it took them, if they set a new high score it will be displayed to the
user.

Good luck with this game! Hope you enjoy!
