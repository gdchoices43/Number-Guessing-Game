# Techdegree Project 1
 My first TechDegree Project

 Unit 1:
 Number Guessing Game:

 """Psuedo-code Hints

 When the program starts, we want to:
 ------------------------------------
 1. Display an intro/welcome message to the player.
 2. Store a random number as the answer/solution.
 3. Continuously prompt the player for a guess.
   a. If the guess greater than the solution, display to the player "It's lower".
   b. If the guess is less than the solution, display to the player "It's higher".

 4. Once the guess is correct, stop looping, inform the user they "Got it"
      and show how many attempts it took them to get the correct number.
 5. Let the player know the game is ending, or something that indicates the game is over.

 ( You can add more features/enhancements if you'd like to. )

 Exceeds requirements:
 -------------------------------------
 1. As a player my guess should be within the number range. If my guess is outside the number
     range I should be told to try again.
 2. As a player of the game after I guess correctly I should be prompted if I would like to
     play again.
 3. As a player of the game, at the start of the game I should be shown the high score(least amount
     of points) so that I know what I am supposed to beat.
 4. Every time a player decides to play again, the random number to the guess is updated so
     players are guessing something new each time.
